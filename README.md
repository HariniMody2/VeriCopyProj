# VeriCopyProj

#The VeriCopy project as it currently stands is effectively a revamping and remodeling of a current software used to generate hash keys for files and compare them to the keys generated once the file is copied, thus ensuring that the file copied correctly. 
#Presently, the original software will not compute keys for files whose path directories exceed 256 characters, nor will it compute keys for files which possess Unicode Wide Characters in the filename. This updated version will be capable of such things and will ultimately serve to replace the original software.
